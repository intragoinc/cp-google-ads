## Section 1 – Where We Pressure Wash for Homeowners

We focus on **hardscape surfaces** around your exterior wood:

- Walkways and front entries  
- Backyard patios and seating areas  
- Pool surrounds and adjacent hardscape  
- Driveways and side paths (by scope)  

We do **not** offer general house washing or gutter/roof services.

## Section 2 – When It Makes Sense

Residential pressure washing works best when:

- You’re already refinishing a deck or siding  
- You want the surrounding hardscape to match the refreshed wood  
- Walkways have become slippery in wet weather  
- Stains, algae or mildew are visible on concrete or pavers  

Many homeowners add pressure washing to a refinishing project to increase overall curb appeal.

## Section 3 – Our Process

1. **Request Estimate** – Tell us which hardscape areas you’d like cleaned.  
2. **On-Site Visit** – Often combined with a deck/siding estimate.  
3. **Proposal** – Pressure washing scoped as its own line item.  
4. **Scheduling** – Usually coordinated with deck/siding maintenance.  
5. **Execution** – Surfaces are cleaned and rinsed by experienced crews.

## Section 4 – Why Add Pressure Washing to Wood Work

- **Single vendor, single schedule** – less coordination for you.  
- **Safer walkways** – reduce slippery surfaces around your home.  
- **Better overall appearance** – wood and hardscape look complete together.
