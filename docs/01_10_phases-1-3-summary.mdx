## Google Ads Rebuild — Phase 1–3 Summary

### Purpose of the Phased Approach

The Google Ads rebuild is intentionally structured into three phases to ensure the system is:
- Designed before scaled
- Measurable at each step
- Expandable without major rework

Each phase adds **one new dimension of complexity at a time**, allowing learnings to compound rather than conflict.

---

## Phase Comparison Overview

| Dimension | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Primary Objective** | Establish a clean, high-quality foundation | Validate geographic scalability | Introduce full persona separation |
| **Geography** | Bay Area only | Bay Area + Fringe | Bay Area + Fringe |
| **Audience / Persona** | Residential only | Residential only | Residential + Commercial (separate) |
| **Campaign Structure** | Service-based | Service-based (unchanged) | Service-based, split by persona |
| **Keyword Strategy** | Phrase + Exact | Phrase + Exact (refined) | Phrase + Exact (persona-specific) |
| **Negative Keywords** | Core exclusions | Expanded by geo learnings | Persona-enforced separation |
| **Landing Pages** | Residential LPs by surface | Same LPs, refined | Dedicated Residential & Commercial LPs |
| **Optimization Focus** | Signal quality & waste reduction | Geo performance & scaling | Persona performance & budget control |
| **Structural Rebuilds** | None | None | None |
| **Advanced Campaign Types** | Deferred | Deferred | Deferred |

## What Changes by Phase

### Phase 1 — Foundation
- Introduces the core service-based architecture
- Establishes clean intent signals
- Replaces underperforming legacy campaigns
- Focuses on control, relevance, and clarity

**Key Outcome:**  
A stable, interpretable Google Ads system that produces reliable performance signals.

---

### Phase 2 — Geographic Scale
- Expands reach into fringe geographies
- Preserves all Phase 1 structure and learnings
- Uses performance data to guide regional budget allocation

**Key Outcome:**  
Confidence that the system scales geographically without dilution or instability.

---

### Phase 3 — Persona Maturity
- Separates Residential and Commercial intent throughout the system
- Introduces persona-specific messaging and landing pages
- Enables independent budgeting and optimization by persona

**Key Outcome:**  
A fully mature core architecture capable of supporting advanced growth initiatives.

---

## What Does *Not* Change Across Phases

The following principles remain constant throughout all phases:

- Phrase and Exact match keyword strategy
- Intent-first campaign design
- SEO-aware, maintainable landing page structures
- Incremental optimization driven by real performance data
- No premature automation or AI-heavy experimentation

---

## Readiness for Future Expansion

Upon completion of Phase 3, the system is positioned to **selectively enable** additional campaign types and formats, such as:
- Performance Max
- Demand Gen / Video
- Additional automation and AI-driven optimization

Any future expansion is intended to be **additive**, preserving the integrity of the core system built in Phases 1–3.

---

## Executive Takeaway

This phased approach transforms Google Ads from a collection of campaigns into a **durable, scalable growth system**.

Each phase is designed to:
- Lock in learnings
- Reduce risk
- Prevent rework
- Support long-term marketing and business objectives
