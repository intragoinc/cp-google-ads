## Phase 2 Scope & Guardrails

### Purpose

Phase 2 extends the **stable foundation established in Phase 1** by expanding geographic coverage while maintaining tight control over structure, intent, and signal quality.

The objective of this phase is to validate scalability across a broader service area **without introducing additional complexity** in personas, campaign types, or automation.

---

## In Scope (Phase 2)

Phase 2 includes the following work:

### Geography
- Bay Area
- Fringe geographies

### Audience / Persona
- Residential-focused campaigns only
- No explicit persona split within Google Ads at this stage

### Campaign Structure
- Continuation of the Phase 1 service-based campaign structure, aligned to:
  - Deck
  - Siding
  - Wood Structures & Furniture
  - Pressure
  - Catch-All / Coverage
- Geographic expansion implemented within the existing structural framework
- No structural rebuilds introduced from Phase 1

### Keywords
- Phrase and Exact match only
- Refinement and selective expansion of keyword sets based on Phase 1 performance
- Continued use of campaign-level and ad-group-level negative keywords

### Landing Pages
- Residential landing pages reused and refined as needed
- Geographic relevance handled through targeting and messaging rather than page proliferation
- URL structures remain consistent and SEO-aware

### Optimization & Scaling
- Ongoing search query review
- Continued negative keyword refinement
- Budget reallocation between Bay Area and Fringe geographies based on performance
- Controlled scaling of spend where efficiency is demonstrated

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase 2)

The following items remain **intentionally deferred** during Phase 2:

### Campaign Types
- Performance Max
- Demand Gen / YouTube
- Discovery-style or feed-based campaigns
- Broad match keyword strategies

### Personas
- Commercial campaigns
- Residential vs. Commercial persona separation

### Creative & Automation
- Large-scale creative testing programs
- AI-heavy bidding or creative experimentation beyond standard best practices

### Landing Pages
- Separate landing pages by micro-geography or city
- Persona-specific landing pages beyond residential

These exclusions preserve **comparability, clarity, and interpretability** of performance as geographic scale increases.

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 2

Phase 2 is considered successful when:

- Residential campaign performance remains stable or improves as geography expands
- Fringe geographies demonstrate measurable, comparable intent quality
- Budget can be confidently shifted between regions based on performance
- The underlying campaign structure remains intact and manageable
- The system is ready for persona-based expansion in Phase 3

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Scale geography before personas**  
- **Expand reach without adding structural complexity**  
- **Preserve learnings from Phase 1**  
- **Optimize before diversifying**

Phase 2 is designed to confirm that the system can scale geographically **without dilution** before introducing additional segmentation dimensions.

---

## Transition to Phase 3

Phase 3 builds on the Phase 2 system by:
- Introducing full Residential vs. Commercial persona separation
- Extending campaign and landing page structures to support persona-specific intent
- Preserving geographic learnings from Bay Area and Fringe performance

No major architectural changes are expected when transitioning into Phase 3.
