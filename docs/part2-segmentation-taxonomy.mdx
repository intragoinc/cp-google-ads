# Cal Preserving Google Ads Initiative
## Part 2 — Segmentation & Taxonomy Layer

---

## 1. Role of Segmentation in This Initiative

In this project, segmentation establishes the **operational geometry** of the Google Ads system — meaning:

> How spend, impressions, leads, and job opportunities map to:
> — services
> — surfaces
> — species
> — geographies
> — job sizes
> — buyer types

Cal Preserving’s profitability varies meaningfully across:

1. **Services** (deck vs siding vs furniture vs pressure)
2. **Geographies** (Bay Area vs Fringe)
3. **Buyers** (residential vs commercial/HOA/PM)
4. **Seasonality windows**
5. **Minimum job sizes**

Therefore, segmentation is not cosmetic — it is foundational to controlling:

- budget allocation
- lead qualification
- estimator routing
- crew utilization
- opportunity value
- cost per acquisition (CAC)
- revenue predictability
