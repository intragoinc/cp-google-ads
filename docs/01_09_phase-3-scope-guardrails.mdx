## Phase 3 Scope & Guardrails

### Purpose

Phase 3 introduces **full persona differentiation** across Cal Preserving’s Google Ads system, building on the stable geographic and structural foundation established in Phases 1 and 2.

The objective of this phase is to separate **Residential and Commercial intent** throughout campaigns, ad groups, and landing pages, while preserving performance stability and structural integrity.

---

## In Scope (Phase 3)

Phase 3 includes the following work:

### Geography
- Bay Area
- Fringe geographies

### Audience / Persona
- Explicit Residential and Commercial persona separation
- Persona differentiation applied consistently across:
  - Campaign structure
  - Ad group organization
  - Ad copy and messaging
  - Landing pages

### Campaign Structure
- Service-based campaign structure maintained and extended by persona, aligned to:
  - Deck
  - Siding
  - Wood Structures & Furniture
  - Pressure
  - Catch-All / Coverage
- Clear separation of Residential vs. Commercial campaigns
- Structural consistency maintained across geographies

### Keywords
- Phrase and Exact match only
- Persona-specific keyword sets and exclusions
- Continued use of campaign-level and ad-group-level negative keywords to prevent intent bleed
- Refinement based on learnings from Phases 1 and 2

### Landing Pages
- Dedicated Residential and Commercial landing pages by service surface
- Clear, one-to-one mapping between persona campaigns and landing pages
- URL structures designed for long-term maintainability and SEO alignment

### Optimization & Maturity
- Persona-specific search query review and refinement
- Ongoing negative keyword optimization to reinforce persona separation
- Budget allocation managed independently by persona and geography
- Stabilization of performance across multiple segmentation dimensions

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase 3)

The following items remain **intentionally deferred** during Phase 3:

### Campaign Types
- Performance Max
- Demand Gen / YouTube
- Discovery-style or feed-based campaigns
- Broad match keyword strategies

### Advanced Automation & Experimentation
- Large-scale AI-driven bidding or creative experimentation
- Fully automated creative generation or testing systems

### Over-Segmentation
- Excessive micro-segmentation beyond service × geography × persona
- City-by-city landing pages unless explicitly justified by performance

These exclusions ensure persona separation is implemented **cleanly and measurably** before introducing additional layers of complexity.

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 3

Phase 3 is considered successful when:

- Residential and Commercial traffic is clearly separated and measurable
- Persona-specific performance trends are visible and interpretable
- Budget decisions can be made independently by persona and geography
- Landing pages align cleanly with persona intent
- The system is ready for future campaign-type expansion without rework

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Persona clarity before automation**  
- **Segmentation with purpose, not complexity**  
- **Maintain structural consistency across all dimensions**  
- **Design for future extensibility**

Phase 3 is not the endpoint of the system, but it represents **full structural maturity** of the core Google Ads architecture.

---

## Future Enablement (Post-Phase 3)

Once Phase 3 is stable, the system is positioned to evaluate and selectively enable:
- Performance Max
- Demand Gen / Video
- Additional automation and AI-driven optimizations

Any such expansion should be additive and **must not compromise the clarity or integrity** of the core system established in Phases 1–3.
