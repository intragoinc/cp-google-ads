# Part 1.2 — Market Context

---

### 1. Market Overview

Exterior wood maintenance in the Bay Area represents a niche but economically attractive segment driven by:

- High installation cost of premium surfaces (redwood, IPE, cedar, teak)
- Environmental wear (UV, salt air, rain cycles)
- Property value preservation
- Aesthetic and lifestyle drivers

Buyers are typically motivated by degradation events (gray, peeling, cupping, mold) or transactional milestones (pre-sale, post-purchase, seasonal refresh).

---

### 2. Installed Base Characteristics

The Bay Area contains a substantial installed base of:

- Wood **decks**
- Wood **siding**
- Wood **furniture** (teak/IPE)
- Wood **fences and exterior structures**

Composite alternatives (e.g., Trex, fiber-cement siding) exist but do not replace the legacy installed base. Composite-related searches largely produce **non-fit traffic** and are handled via negative strategies.

---

### 3. Demand Behavior

Residential demand concentrates around:

- Spring → Summer (outdoor usage)
- Pre-sale transactions
- Weather-driven deterioration events

Commercial/HOA/Property Manager demand is more stable and less seasonal, with triggers such as:

- Board approvals
- Multi-unit maintenance cycles
- Surface degradation complaints
- Liability and safety concerns

---

### 4. Buyer Knowledge Levels

Buyer search queries span three knowledge tiers:

**Tier 1 — Specific Species**
> “refinish redwood deck bay area”, “restore ipe siding”

**Tier 2 — Generic Surface**
> “deck refinishing near me”, “wood siding staining”

**Tier 3 — Problem-Based**
> “gray deck”, “mold on siding”

The initiative must support all three tiers while filtering out DIY and retail/product-only queries.

---

### 5. Price Sensitivity & Fit

The market contains two price sensitivity zones:

1. **High-fit**
   - Homeowners with higher-value properties
   - Commercial / HOA / PM
   - Multi-surface / multi-unit jobs

2. **Low-fit**
   - Budget handyman seekers
   - DIY retail queries
   - Single-chair teak inquiries
   - Small one-off fence sections

Negative keyword strategy and campaign structure reduce low-fit infiltration.

---

### 6. Competitive Environment

The segment is fragmented:

- Painters (broad)
- Deck specialists (niche)
- Handymen (low-cost)
- Landscape / exterior service companies (adjacent)
- Composite installers (orthogonal)

Differentiation for Cal Preserving centers on:

- Wood expertise
- Surface longevity outcomes
- Premium species handling (hardwood umbrella)
- Multi-surface capability
- Crew professionalism

---

### 7. Commercial Opportunity

Commercial represents a material upside because:

- Job sizes are larger
- Surfaces are clustered
- Repeat cycles exist
- Budgets are approved at organizational level

However commercial search behavior differs (less “near me”, more “Bay Area” and property-type naming). This informs Phase 3 persona breakout.

---

### 8. Summary

The market supports a structured Google Ads strategy that identifies and targets high-fit surface + geo combinations first, then expands into commercial/HOA/PM where economic upside and repeatability are strongest.
