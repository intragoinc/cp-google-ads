## Phase 1 Scope & Guardrails

### Purpose

Phase 1 establishes a **stable, high-quality foundation** for Cal Preserving’s Google Ads program.  
The goal is to replace underperforming campaigns with a focused, well-structured system that can be measured, tuned, and confidently expanded in later phases.

This phase prioritizes **clarity, control, and signal quality** over breadth or experimentation.

---

## In Scope (Phase 1)

Phase 1 includes the following work:

### Geography
- Bay Area only

### Audience / Persona
- Residential-focused campaigns
- No explicit persona split within Google Ads at this stage

### Campaign Structure
- Core service-based campaign structure, aligned to:
  - Deck
  - Siding
  - Wood Structures & Furniture
  - Pressure
  - Catch-All / Coverage
- Campaign and ad group structure designed to scale into future phases without rework

### Keywords
- Phrase and Exact match only
- Intent-focused keyword selection
- Campaign-level and ad-group-level negative keyword design

### Landing Pages
- Residential landing pages URL's aligned to service surfaces
- Clear campaign-to-landing-page mapping
- URL structures designed to remain maintainable and SEO-aware

### Initial Optimization
- Early search query review
- Negative keyword refinement
- Initial budget adjustments based on early performance signals

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Phase 1)

The following items are **intentionally deferred** and not part of Phase 1:

### Campaign Types
- Performance Max
- Demand Gen / YouTube
- Discovery-style or feed-based campaigns
- Broad match keyword strategies

### Personas
- Commercial campaigns
- Residential vs. Commercial persona separation

### Geography
- Fringe or out-of-area geographies

### Advanced Automation
- AI-heavy bidding or creative experimentation beyond standard best practices
- Large-scale creative testing programs

These items are deferred to ensure Phase 1 data is **clean, interpretable, and actionable**.

---

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

Phase 1 is considered successful when:

- Campaign structure is stable and clearly organized
- Traffic quality aligns with intended residential service intent
- Search queries show strong relevance and minimal waste
- Landing pages are functioning as intended for paid traffic
- The system is ready to expand **without structural changes**

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Foundation before expansion**  
- **Control before automation**  
- **Signal quality over volume**  
- **Design for longevity, not quick wins**

Phase 1 is not designed to maximize reach or spend. It is designed to establish a durable system that supports confident growth in Phases 2 and 3.

---

## Transition to Phase 2

Phase 2 builds directly on the Phase 1 foundation by:
- Expanding geography (Bay Area + Fringe)
- Maintaining residential focus
- Preserving core structure and learnings from Phase 1

No major rebuild is expected when transitioning between phases.
