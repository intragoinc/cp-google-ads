# Part 1.5 — Surface Model

---

## 1. Overview

Cal Preserving works across a wide range of exterior wood surfaces. Buyers do not always articulate surface type accurately in search queries, so the initiative uses a normalized internal model.

The surface model impacts:

- Campaign grouping
- Landing pages
- Keyword intent
- Salesforce attribution
- Phase sequencing

---

## 2. Surface Categories (Normalized)

The normalized surface taxonomy uses **five** top-level categories:

1. **Deck**
2. **Siding**
3. **Structures**
4. **Pressure (Hardscape)**
5. **Catch-All (Exterior Wood)**

This taxonomy maps efficiently to search behavior and ad groups.

---

## 3. Subsurface Breakdown (Informational)

| Category | Included Surfaces |
|---|---|
| **Deck** | Decking, railings, stairs, balconies |
| **Siding** | Wood siding, cladding, facades |
| **Structures** | Fences, gates, trellis, арbors, pergolas, gazebos, patio furniture |
| **Pressure (Hardscape)** | Concrete, stone, patio hardscape pressure washing |
| **Catch-All** | Mixed-use “exterior wood” queries |

The **Structures** category intentionally combines fencing + furniture + exterior architectural wood to reduce early fragmentation.

---

## 4. Preservative vs Hardscape Note

Important operational distinction:

- **Pressure washing (wood)** is included inside Deck / Siding / Structures prep.
- **Pressure washing (hardscape only)** is broken out as **Pressure (Hardscape)** because:
  - It is frequently purchased as a standalone commercial/HOA job.
  - It supports “lead magnet” use cases.
  - It affects minimum job pricing differently.

---

## 5. Landing Page Alignment

Each surface maps to its own landing page:

| Surface | LP Exists in Phase |
|---|---|
| **Deck** | Phase 1 |
| **Siding** | Phase 1 |
| **Structures** | Phase 1 |
| **Pressure** | Phase 1 |
| **Catch-All** | Phase 1 |

LPs are not duplicated by geo in early phases. Phase 3 introduces persona duplication:

| Persona Split Phase | Residential LP | Commercial LP |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 3** | Yes | Yes |

---

## 6. Form Behavior

Form collects normalized surface selection as:

> **Multi-select field (M1):**  
> “Deck;Fence;Hardscape;Furniture;Siding”

Primary surface value is resolved using:

IF Siding selected THEN PRIMARY = Siding
ELSE IF Deck selected THEN PRIMARY = Deck
ELSE IF Structures selected THEN PRIMARY = Structures
ELSE IF Furniture only THEN PRIMARY = Furniture
ELSE IF Pressure only THEN PRIMARY = Pressure

This avoids catch-all logic.

---

## 7. Search Intent Alignment

Search intent aligns cleanly:

| Surface | Example Query Patterns |
|---|---|
| Deck | “deck refinishing”, “deck restoration”, “ipe deck staining” |
| Siding | “cedar siding restoration”, “wood siding refinishing” |
| Structures | “wood fence restoration”, “patio furniture refinishing” |
| Pressure | “concrete pressure washing”, “hardscape cleaning” |
| Catch-All | “exterior wood repair”, “wood restoration company” |

---

## 8. Commercial Considerations

Commercial / HOA / PM buyers search less by surface and more by:

- Property type (apartment, HOA, condo complex)
- Stakeholder role (facility manager, PM, board)
- Project scale (“multi building”)

Surface terms still matter but appear later in queries or RFQ.

Phase 3 introduces persona split for this.

---

## 9. Operational Mapping to Salesforce

Salesforce attributes use **normalized surface** to support downstream reporting:

- Close rate by surface
- Job size by surface
- Margin by surface
- Seasonal impact by surface

This enables economics-driven budget allocation.

---

## 10. Summary

Surface taxonomy is foundational to:

- Campaign architecture
- Landing experiences
- Form capture
- Salesforce reporting
- Persona expansion (Phase 3)

It allows Cal Preserving to sell the right work, not just any work.
