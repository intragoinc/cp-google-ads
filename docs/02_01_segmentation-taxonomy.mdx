# Part 2.1 — Segmentation & Taxonomy Model

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **canonical segmentation and taxonomy model** for the Cal Preserving Google Ads system.

It is the **source of truth** for:

- Campaign design  
- CSV masters (Phase 1–3)  
- Landing page mapping  
- CTA rules  
- Persona behavior  
- Geo behavior  
- Reporting keys  

Routing, Salesforce configuration, and phone-based attribution are **out of scope** here.

## 2. Core Dimensions

The system is built on six core segmentation dimensions:

1. **Phase** — rollout stage of the system  
2. **Geo** — bay_area vs fringe  
3. **Persona** — residential vs commercial (Phase 3 only)  
4. **Surface** — deck, siding, structures, pressure, catch_all  
5. **Campaign Concept** — combination of geo + surface (+ persona in Phase 3)  
6. **Keyword Intent** — repair / restoration / maintenance / finishing / species / pressure / generic / catch_all

These dimensions must remain stable across:

- Google Ads campaigns and ad groups  
- CSV master files  
- Landing page structure  
- Reporting and dashboards
